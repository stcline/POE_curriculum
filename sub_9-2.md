## 1. Kirchhoff’s Current Law in a Series Circuit

Kirchhoff’s Current Law (KCL) states that the total current entering a junction must equal the total current leaving the junction. In a series circuit, like the one shown in Figure 9, there are no junctions where the current can split. Therefore, the current that flows through each resistor is the same. 

### Explanation:
- **Series Circuit:** In this configuration, all components are connected end-to-end, forming a single path for current flow.
- **Current Consistency:** Since there are no branches in a series circuit, the same current flows through each resistor. According to KCL, if the current entering a component is $$I$$, then $$I$$ must also exit that component and enter the next one.

### Diagram:
The diagram shows a single loop with a power source and two resistors connected in series. The same current $$I$$ flows through each resistor.

## 2. Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law in a Parallel Circuit

Kirchhoff’s Voltage Law (KVL) states that the sum of the electrical potential differences (voltage) around any closed network is zero. In a parallel circuit, as shown in Figure 10, each branch is directly connected to the voltage source.

### Explanation:
- **Parallel Circuit:** Each resistor is connected across the same two points, meaning they all share the same voltage.
- **Voltage Equality:** According to KVL, because each resistor is directly connected across the power source, they all experience the same voltage drop equal to the source voltage.

### Diagram:
The diagram shows a power source with two resistors connected in parallel. Each resistor has the same voltage $$V$$ across it, as they are both directly connected to the terminals of the power supply.
